We're thrilled to announce the initial release of **Forward**, a TypeScript framework designed to simplify building agentic AI applications.

Our goal is to provide a robust foundation for creating AI assistants that can leverage large language models, use custom tools, and offer deep observability into their behavior.

**Getting Started:**

*   Dive into the **[Quick Start guide](/docs/quick-start)** to get up and running.
*   Explore the **[Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/agent)** to understand the fundamentals.
*   Check out the **[Examples](https://github.com/DEM1989/helse-agentic-library/tree/main/examples)** on GitHub.

**Join the Community:**

Forward is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions! Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a feature, or contribute code, please see our **[Contributing Guide](/docs/contributing)**.

You can track changes and updates in our **[Changelog](/docs/changelog)**.

We're excited to see what you build!
